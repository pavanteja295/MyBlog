##  Hey there !

This is a budding digital garden (come back after an year!) made public where I archive my learnings projected through my self made notes. 

### Why go public ?  

I lately realised the importance of note making (in 2023 or so during my masters) but quickly started to tame my second brain and managed my personal knowledge locally on my system.  My note taking was quite regulated in the beginning as I could see the immediate value of making notes (in the form of my academic grades). 

I was also personally was an entirely different being back then ( was religiously brainwashed by the hype culture glorifying  self-discipline, motivation, success and all sorts of blah blah blah :P ).  Nevertheless I moved away from this mindset (for good!).

What didn't fade away was that little spark of curiosity to know and create!  However, I found my current mental framework lacked the driving force to keep my note taking organised and consistent.  Then it clicked: social conditioning and fear of judgment could rekindle my forgotten diligence.  

### What to expect ?

1. Please don't waste your time! For now its  just some course notes I am currently pursuing. 
2. I also want to put down short summaries about the books that I read.
3.  If my drawing skills becomes any better (like 10x) I will upload some of the artwork I will be doing. 

### Who is this blog intended for 

1. For now its only me. I am writing this blog solely to track my efforts that are projects in the form of these notes.  

### Self-commitment

1. I will try to post one note for every two weeks to ensure I put on something here.
